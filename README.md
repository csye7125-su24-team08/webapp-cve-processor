# CVE Processor Webapp

This project contains an app that processes all the CVEs from the ZIP provided by the CVE website and pushes them to kafka topic.

## CVE Processor

The CVE Processor requires the following environment variables to be set to download files and push them to kafka topic:

- `fileurl` - `$FILEURL`
- `brokers` - `$BROKERS`
- `topic` - `$TOPIC`

These variables can be set using Docker environment variables or, in our case, Kubernetes secrets with Helm.

## Docker config for `cve_processor`

The `Dockerfile.webapp` will be run as a container. This container downloads the CVE archive, decompresses it, and pushes each record to Kafka.
